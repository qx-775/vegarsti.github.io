[Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net/) and others ([Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), [David Winterbottom](https://til.codeinthehole.com/)) have started posting their Today I Learned snippets, or TILs for short.

Occasionally over the past couple years, I've noted down a useful command, fact or code snippet in a folder.
Instead of just keeping these in a private Git repo, I decided to do the same:

1. I created a site on Netlify with the subdomain - which was super easy, by the way!
2. I copied the design and scripts that Winterbottom uses - [here's my Git repo](https://github.com/vegarsti/til).
3. I migrated my existing notes to the new format.

And all of a sudden I had a site of my snippets, which isn't even empty.

Head over to [til.vegardstikbakke.com](https://til.vegardstikbakke.com) to check it out!
