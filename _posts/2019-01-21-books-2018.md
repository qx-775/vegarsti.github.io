title: Books I read in 2018
---

As a kid I read a lot of books. Not so the last couple of years. In 2018 I managed to get thoroughly into reading again. There is just so much to learn, and the more I read, the more I want to read. If you're interested, [this is my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3400170-vegard-stikbakke).

In 2018, I apparently read around 5000 pages total over 16 books (see [My Year in Books on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/3400170)). I'm pretty satisfied with that. The themes of the books seem to be mainly business, startups, tech and biographies.

Here's a list of the books I read. Those in bold are especially recommended.

- **Why We Sleep** by Matthew Walker
- The Lean Startup by Eric Ries
- **The Everything Store** by Brad Stone
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz
- The Mythical Man-Month by Frederik P. Brooks Jr.
- Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis
- Zero to One by Peter Thiel
- In the Plex by Steven Levy
- Fresh Off the Boat by Eddie Huang
- Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
- The New New Thing by Michael Lewis
- The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier
- **Bad Blood** by John Carreyrou
- **A Philosophy of Software Design** by John Ousterhout
- Masters of Doom by David Kushner
- **Stoner** by John Williams (only fiction book this year)

I got a Kindle for Christmas, and I'm loving it so far. Looking forward to reading more this year!
